# **Author Notes**

This document is a working draft of a journal paper summarizing the Brewer Lake watershed study. A few notes:  

- *Authorship*: The authorship list is simply a first volley based on contributions to the USACE report. Team members can be added as needed, and we need to discuss the relative order of authors.  
- *Potential audience*: Largely focused on applied water science community and practitioners developing watershed management plans. Secondary audience is government entities funding watershed assessments. Probably best reached through an open access journal.  
- *Potential outlets* (in rough submission order): [Water](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/water) (a lower bar but fast turn-around),  [Journal of the American Water Resources Association](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/17521688) (incredibly slow but lots of watershed assessment focus), [PLOS Water](https://journals.plos.org/water/) (probably more hypothesis-driven that our analysis)  
- *What is this document*: This outline is structured where each text block is envisioned as roughly a paragraph of content. Current text will be rewritten and is simply intended to be a placeholder for ideas.

**Keywords**: watershed plan, multi-criteria decision analysis, HSPF, watershed modeling, integrated modeling

# **Introduction**

General background and context: Watershed assessment is a common need. Driven by policy goals (e.g., EPA 319 processes) as well as needs for efficiently investing limited management dollars (find example of local group). Long history of examples (e.g., Chesapeake). 

What is the status quo: Integrated modeling tools to inform decisions (Lamy et al. 2002). Predictive watershed modeling a crucial step (McKay et al. 2019). Multi-purpose watershed management is becoming more common (Lim and Lee 2009, Hoang et al. 2018, Vercruysse et al. 2019, Gatgash and Sadeghi 2023, Halder et al. 2023, Menichino et al. 2025). 

What is wrong with the status quo: Multi-criteria methods are emerging to help navigate preferences (Yaryan Hall and Bledsoe 2023). However, methods often include cost as a criteria (rather than a constraint), which may obscure trade-offs inherent in watershed assessment (Newbold 2002). Techniques tend to emphasize a linear process rather than an iterative workflow. Methods usually focus on a single approach to inform decisions rather than a weight-of-evidence based on multiple methods (Linkov). Structured decision making is a family of tools (Hemming), and many tools may be brought to bear on a single project. 

What is this paper contributing: Our objectives are to: (1) develop techniques for rapidly informing watershed prioritization and (2) demonstrate the merits of integrated modeling with many tools. We present these methods in the context of a watershed study for Brewer Lake in Arkansas, USA. Techniques are provided in the spirit of sharing a case study. 

# **Methods**

## *Brewer Lake Watershed*

Brewer Lake is located in central Arkansas within the Arkansas Valley ecoregion, a transitional zone between the Ozark Mountains to the north and the Ouachita Mountains to the south. In 1983, the Brewer Lake reservoir was completed and is fed by Cypress Creek, which drains a 36 mi^2^ watershed (HUC boundary 111102050201). The reservoir serves as the primary drinking water supply for the city of Conway, and this municipal water supply reservoir provides the main context for this watershed study. 

The high ridge slopes and moderate valley slopes of the Cypress Creek watershed make it representative of the broader Arkansas Valley physiographic province in which is resides (Hart 2014). Soils are predominantly sandy loam and silty loam with good drainage in the hydrologic soil groups C, C/D, and D. The climate is humid subtropical with hot, humid summers and mild winters. Average annual rainfall is 58 inches (NLDAS) with higher amounts in spring (5-7 inches per month) and lower amounts in summer and fall (3-5 inches per month). Average annual streamflow is 32 cfs (USGS Streamflow Gauge No. 07261090) with peak flows of more than 16,500 cfs, although zero flow periods can also extend for months (Santeford and Martin 1980). These hydrographic patterns are consistent with the intermittent flashy and intermittent runoff flow regimes characteristic of regional rivers (Leasure et al. 2016). Historically, the Arkansas Valley Hills ecoregion (EPA Level IV, Woods et al. 2004) would have included oak-hickory forest or oak-hickory-pine forest, and significant portions of the watershed remain as second- or third-growth deciduous forest, although evergreen forest and pasture are now common land uses as well (Hart 2014). Based on the 2020 census, population density is relatively low in the watershed with 36.5 residents per mi^2^ (96 residents per mi^2^ nationwide), and residents experience higher rates of poverty and unemployment than state averages (EJScreen 2025). 

Watershed land use reflects the long history of occupation in the catchment as well as the low population density (Figure 1). Based on the 2021 National Land Cover Database, the major land use remains forest (45%), although the forest types now include deciduous, evergreen, mixed, and shrub/scrub systems. The second most common land use is pasture (42%), although the predominant agricultural effects stem from confined animal feeding operations like poultry houses. Urban land uses are isolated (7%), and residents rely primarily on septic tanks for wastewater management. Road networks are also limited, although a significant extent of unpaved roads may be important sediment sources (**XXX**, personal communication). Oil extraction using hydraulic fracturing (i.e., “fracking”) has increased across the entire Arkansas River Valley ecoregion (Baker et al. 2018), including the Cypress Valley watershed (Hart 2015), with potential impacts of these activities on water availability (Davis 2012) and stream biota (Johnson et al. 2015). Notably, riparian areas in the watershed remain relatively intact with 62% of area within 100-ft of streams in forested land uses.

```

Brewer Lake was completed in 1983 through a partnership between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Conway Corporation, based on authorization from the Water Resources Development Act of 1974 (PL93-251, Title 1, Sec. 10). The primary purpose of the 28,500 acre-foot reservoir is water supply for over 70,000 residents in the city of Conway as well as nearby counties, although the lake is also used for fishing and recreation. Water quality changes can occur with land use change, and sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorous inputs to the lake are a particular focus for reservoir managers because of both drinking water requirements as well as secondary outcomes like harmful algal blooms (HABs) and reduced reservoir life span (**XXX**, personal observation). In the fall of 2020, a cyanobacterial bloom was observed intermittently, indicating a broader potential for water quality threats to this important drinking water source.

#Specify colors for each of the constituents
PLET.colors <- viridis(3)
```


## *Watershed Modeling*

**Items to cover in this section**.  

- Why is watershed modeling needed? Establish baseline conditions, understand sources at locations without data, predict effectiveness of management actions (eventually).  
- HSPF model setup: inputs, spatial and temporal resolution, calibration, goodness-of-fit.
- Model application to estimate load for sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorous.


## *Prioritization of Catchments*

The extent of BMP application may be significantly reduced, if actions are placed strategically throughout the watershed in locations with the greatest return-on-investment. This section describes a suite of analyses to identify strategically important catchments for BMP application. The HSPF model used 60 sub-catchments to provide sufficient predictive capability, but this spatial resolution was considered finer scale (**XXX** mi^2^ average size) than needed for management. These sub-catchments were aggregated into 26 larger catchments for prioritization purposes (**XXX** mi^2^ average size), based on slope, soil type, land use, and proximity to Brewer Lake. 

To identify high-reward areas, or areas in the watershed where BMPs would provide the greatest return-on-investment, the sub-catchments were prioritized using two different methods: ranking and multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The ranking method identified sub-catchments with high pollutant loading and feasibility for management based on separate criteria. Conversely, the MCDA compared each sub-catchment based on a weighted average of multiple criteria summarized in a single score. Each technique provides different insights into the prioritization process, and catchments identified as high reward under different sets of assumptions provide confidence that BMP application in these areas will provide the greatest return-on-investment.

### *Prioritization Method 1 – Ranking*

Two main factors often drive the efficacy of a watershed management action. First, will it achieve the technical objectives (in this case related to sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorous reduction)? Second, can the action be feasibly implemented? The highest priority actions would then be those where actions are feasible to achieve the load reduction goals. 

The flux of sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorous from HSPF were used to assess the degree to which technical objectives were achieved. The catchments were ranked from lowest to highest loading for each constituent. The average rank across all three constituents was used as a general proxy for identifying “problem areas” in the watershed. 

Ideally, the feasibility of an action could be assessed relative to the total project cost, stakeholder surveys, or other data. However, no direct metrics were available for all sites in this watershed, and a suite of proxy metrics were used as a relative metric of feasibility. First, appraised land value from tax records was used as a general proxy for affordability. Second, the forested proportion of a 100-foot riparian area was used as a surrogate for the durability of BMPs with the assumption that, all things equal, BMPs would perform better in sites with forested buffers. Third, time of travel from the catchment outlet to Brewer Lake (from HSPF) was used as a proxy for the directness of the effects on Brewer Lake water quality. The catchments were then ranked from lowest to highest on these factors, and the average rank was used as a general proxy for the feasibility of actions.

The relative rankings of load and feasibility factors provided multiple pathways for identifying priority catchments. First, catchments were selected that provided the greatest level of either technical outcomes or feasibility. Second, catchments were identified based on trade-off analysis analogous to cost-effectiveness analysis (Newbold 2002, Menichino et al. 2025). Catchments with higher feasibility at the same level of water quality load or higher pollutant load at the same level of feasibility were identified as "dominant" alternatives. Finally, catchments providing low levels of either technical objectives or feasibility were eliminated from consideration in future analysis.

brewer.rank$Feasibility <- apply(cbind(brewer.rank$Affordability, brewer.rank$Buffer, brewer.rank$TravelTime), 1, mean)
```

### *Prioritization Method 2 – Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA)*

Many methods have been developed for comparing disparate metrics using a spectrum of qualitative to quantitative techniques (Linkov et al. 2009). Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) provides a set of methods for normalizing metrics with different units and scales and combining those metrics into a single score for comparing alternatives, which has proven particularly useful for the multi-objective context of watershed planning (Yaryan Hall and Bledsoe 2023).

A form of MCDA was used to prioritize catchments in the Brewer Lake watershed using a weighted-score based on multiple criteria. Five criteria were included in this analysis: flux of sediment, flux of total nitrogen, flux of total phosphorous, proportion of land use in pasture, and distance from the catchment outlet to Brewer Lake. All metrics were converted to a 1 to 5 scale for comparison across different units with 1 and 5 representing less and more preferrable outcomes, respectively. Flux scores were computed based on the quantiles of the data from 0-20%, 20-40%, 40-60%, 60-80%, and 80-100% with corresponding scores of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Land use was assessed based on proportion of pasture in the catchment with thresholds at < 30%, 30-40%, 40-50%, 50-60%, and > 60% for 1 to 5 scores. Distance to the lake was normalized as 0 miles, 0-1 miles, 1-2 miles, 2-3 miles, 3-4 miles, and > 4 miles for scores 5 to 1. Weighting was determined based on pairwise comparison of the relative importance of each criteria, where sediment, nitrogen, phosphorous, land use, and distance were ultimately weighted as 20%, 27%, 33%, 13%, and 7%, respectively. All normalized metrics were combined through a weighted-average to produce an overall score for each catchment on a 1 to 5 scale, where 5 represents the highest priority catchment.

# **Discussion**

**Potential topics that could be ripe for discussion**.  

- Methods for multi-purpose planning are rapidly evolving. Methods can be applied in conjunction (rather than picking one approach).
- Multi-purpose planning is hard. Trade-offs are challenging to think through. Secondary objectives were important here, but played little role in decision making.  
- Watershed prioritization is simply the first step. More detailed analyses are needed for site-scale design.  
- The temporal scale of watershed planning is long-term, so we need to arm decision-makers with general targets and ranges of effort (not just a hit list of projects).
