# **Author Notes**

This document is a working draft of a journal paper summarizing the Brewer Lake watershed study. A few notes:  

- *Authorship*: The authorship list is simply a first volley based on contributions to the USACE report. Team members can be added as needed, and we need to discuss the relative order of authors.  
- *Potential audience*: Largely focused on applied water science community and practitioners developing watershed management plans. Secondary audience is government entities funding watershed assessments. Probably best reached through an open access journal.  
- *Potential outlets* (in rough submission order): [Water](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/water) (a lower bar but fast turn-around),  [Journal of the American Water Resources Association](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/17521688) (incredibly slow but lots of watershed assessment focus), [PLOS Water](https://journals.plos.org/water/) (probably more hypothesis-driven that our analysis)

# **Abstract**

**Insert after the paper is written**. A mock-up (i.e., pseudo-sentences) for Brewer Lake might look something like...Watershed assessment is a common management concern AND integrated modeling tools are available to inform understanding of hydrology, sedimentation, ecology, and social outcomes. BUT it is not always clear how to effectively synthesize these lines of evidence to inform decision making. THEREFORE, we demonstrate how weight-of-evidence methods can be applied to integrate diverse types of information and analyses. We present these methods in the context of a watershed study for Brewer Lake in Arkansas, USA. Something specific about the Brewer Lake methods and findings.

**Keywords**: watershed plan, multi-criteria decision analysis, HSPF, watershed modeling, integrated modeling


# **1. Introduction**

A watershed is “the landscape that contributes surface water to a single location, such as a point on a stream or river, or a single wetland, lake or other waterbody” (Flotemersch et al. 2016). Catchments integrate physical, chemical, and biological processes and provide a fundamental unit for analysis of lands and waters (Montgomery et al. 1995), although watersheds may not align with governance issues due to boundary difference, accountability structures, and participatory processes (Cohen and Davidson 2011). Watershed assessments can be driven by large-scale policy goals (e.g., the US Environmental Protection Agency's 319 program, Hanson et al. 2022) as well as local project-scale goals (e.g., stream restoration prioritization, Menchino et al. 2025). However, generally speaking, watershed assessments seek to capture the status and trends of different functional outcomes like landscape condition, geomorphology, hydrology, water quality, habitat, or biological conditions (USEPA 2012). 

Effective watershed management has long acknowledged the need for integrating multiple outcomes and goals (Montgomery 1995, Wang et al. 2016). An integrated assessment approach ultimately facilitates understanding of individual components as well as the integrity of the watershed as a whole (Flotemersch et al. 2016). Modeling tools have not only matured for assessing and forecasting hydrologic and water quality processes (e.g., Shiferaw et al. 2025, Chao et al. 2023) but also ecological and social outcomes (e.g., McKay et al. 2019, Meerow and Newell 2017). To effectively reach decision makers, diverse outcomes need to be synthesized into overarching findings and priorities addressing multiple objectives (Montgomery 1995, Lamy et al. 2002, Newbold 2002). Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques have emerged as particularly useful methods for watershed assessment with synthesis methods reliant on visual summaries (Hoang et al. 2017), spatially distributed methods (Lim and Lee 2009, Yaryan-Hall and Bledsoe 2023), and coupling with optimization methods (Li et al. 2023). 

Multi-criteria watershed assessment is emerging as an important paradigm for navigating trade-offs between diverse objectives; however, tools need to be translated to align with the diverse contexts in which watershed planning occurs. For instance, many MCDA methods have emphasized the benefits of achieving objectives (e.g., Meerow and Newell 2017, Yaryan-Hall and Bledsoe 2023) rather than challenges of working under constraints like limited financial resources or land ownership. A focus on objectives without constraints could obscure trade-offs inherent in some watershed management choices (Newbold 2002). Furthermore, while diverse methods exist for comparing lines of evidence (Linkov et al. 2009), many applications focus on use of a single analytical method at the expense of using multiple methods with alternative assumptions or pitfalls. Lastly, watershed assessment exists across a spectrum from preliminary site screening to long-term health monitoring, and MCDA tools are needed that align with these different levels of analytical effort (Larsen et al. 2016, Harris et al. 2023).

In this paper, we contribute to the growing body of methods using MCDA to inform watershed management. Specifically, our objectives are to (1) incorporate constraints like cost and land ownership into MCDA frameworks, (2) show how multiple MCDA-based methods can be brought to bear at a single location to increase decision confidence, and (3) demonstrate simple MCDA methods that are aligned with preliminary watershed planning. We present these methods in the context of developing a watershed management plan for the Brewer Lake watershed in Arkansas, USA. The methods and techniques shown here were tailored to the geographic and project constraints for this watershed, and we offer these in the spirit of a case study exploring alternative approaches rather than research into preferred or superior approaches.


# **2. Methods**

Many stepwise processes have been proposed for developing watershed management plans centered on general land management concerns (e.g., Montgomery et al. 1995), pollutant load reduction (e.g., USEPA 2008), integrated assessment (e.g., USEPA 2012), and shared visioning with stakeholders (e.g., USACE 2022). These processes share commonalities in the steps and generally include topics like building context, setting objectives, understanding the status and trends of watershed condition, identifying effective management actions, and informing decisions. Here, we draw from each of these frameworks and take a question-centric approach to watershed planning. Specifically, our analysis focuses on six overarching questions, which then structure the subsequent methods and results sections.  

- *What is the context for this watershed (Section 2.1)*? Watersheds are complex social-ecological-technical systems with many interacting components and processes (McPhearson et al. 2021). Effective watershed management require understanding these dimensions of the system as well as how they have changed through time.  
- *What are the objectives and constraints for this planning process (Section 2.2)*? Management actions can only be prioritized with a clear understanding the the problems, opportunities, objectives, and constraints (USACE 2022). For instance, different actions could be identified as preferable relative to sediment load reduction and recreational access. Similarly, project constraints arise from issues like land ownership, jurisdictional limits, and site access (USEPA 2008), and analytical constraints related to model complexity, tolerable uncertainty, time, and available resource drive choices about the level of effort for a given analysis (Harris et al. 2023).  
- *What numerical targets are feasible and realistic (Section 2.3)*? Objective setting often leads to laudably ambitious goals, but numerical targets are sometimes set at unattainable levels from a technical perspective. Watershed planning sometimes requires preliminary analyses to avoid miscommunication and the potential for a gap between ambition and reality.  
- *What is the status and trends of key watershed properties (Section 2.4)*? Objective setting identifies outcomes that are important to watershed stakeholders, which may then be modeled or monitored over time to understand the condition and trajectory of the watershed.  
- *What areas are priorities for management actions (Section 2.5)*? Specific parts of the watershed (e.g., smaller catchments, project sites) may then be prioritized relative to the condition assessment and goals. These locations are often identified based on "problem areas", site feasibility (i.e., "low hanging fruit"), land ownership, and other factors, which may then be compared with a variety of techniques.  
- *How do prioritized activities contribute to overarching goals (Section 2.6)*? Many watershed studies prioritize actions in a small portion of the watershed, but there is often a need to revisit watershed objectives as a whole to understand the importance of these smaller scale actions at a larger scale (Menichino et al. 2025).


## *2.1. Brewer Lake Watershed*

Brewer Lake is located in central Arkansas within the Arkansas Valley ecoregion, a transitional zone between the Ozark Mountains to the north and the Ouachita Mountains to the south. In 1983, the Brewer Lake reservoir was completed and is fed by Cypress Creek, which drains a 36 mi^2^ watershed (HUC boundary 111102050201). The reservoir serves as the primary drinking water supply for the city of Conway, and this municipal water supply reservoir provides the main context for this watershed study. 

The high ridge slopes and moderate valley slopes of the Cypress Creek watershed make it representative of the broader Arkansas Valley physiographic province in which it resides (Hart 2014). Soils are predominantly sandy loam and silty loam with good drainage in the hydrologic soil groups C, C/D, and D. The climate is humid subtropical with hot, humid summers and mild winters. Average annual rainfall is 58 inches (NLDAS) with higher amounts in spring (5-7 inches per month) and lower amounts in summer and fall (3-5 inches per month). Average annual streamflow is 32 cfs (USGS Streamflow Gauge No. 07261090) with peak flows of more than 16,500 cfs, although zero flow periods can also extend for months (Santeford and Martin 1980). These hydrographic patterns are consistent with the intermittent flashy and intermittent runoff flow regimes characteristic of regional rivers (Leasure et al. 2016). Historically, the Arkansas Valley Hills ecoregion (EPA Level IV, Woods et al. 2004) would have included oak-hickory forest or oak-hickory-pine forest, and significant portions of the watershed remain as second- or third-growth deciduous forest, although evergreen forest and pasture are now common land uses as well (Hart 2014). Based on the 2020 census, population density is relatively low in the watershed with 36.5 residents per mi^2^ (96 residents per mi^2^ nationwide), and residents experience higher rates of poverty and unemployment than state averages (EJScreen 2025). 

Watershed land use reflects the long history of development as well as the low population density (Figure 1). Based on the 2021 National Land Cover Database, the major land use remains forest (45%), although forest types now include deciduous, evergreen, mixed, and shrub/scrub systems. The second most common land use is pasture (42%) with predominant agricultural effects stemming from confined animal feeding operations like poultry houses. Urban land uses are isolated (7%), and residents rely primarily on septic tanks for wastewater management. Road networks are also limited, although a significant extent of unpaved roads may be important sediment sources (**XXX**, personal communication). Oil extraction using hydraulic fracturing (i.e., “fracking”) has increased across the entire Arkansas River Valley ecoregion (Baker et al. 2018), including the Cypress Valley watershed (Hart 2014), with potential impacts of these activities on water availability (Davis 2012) and stream biota (Johnson et al. 2015). Notably, riparian areas in the watershed remain relatively intact with 62% of area within 100-ft of streams in forested land uses.

Brewer Lake was completed in 1983 through a partnership between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Conway Corporation, based on authorization from the Water Resources Development Act of 1974 (PL93-251, Title 1, Sec. 10). The primary purpose of the 28,500 acre-foot reservoir is water supply for over 70,000 residents in the city of Conway as well as nearby counties, although the lake is also used for fishing and recreation. Water quality changes can occur with land use change, and sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorous inputs to the lake are a particular focus for reservoir managers because of both drinking water requirements as well as secondary outcomes like harmful algal blooms and reduced reservoir life span (Mark Ferguson, Conway Corporation, personal observation). In the fall of 2020, a cyanobacterial bloom was observed intermittently, indicating a broader potential for water quality threats to this important drinking water source (Matthew Schroeder, Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, personal observation).

## *2.2. Watershed Planning Process*

(**Michael, I need your help here**).  

This study was conducted under a partnership between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Conway Corporation to develop a long-term vision for the watershed, identify preliminary management actions, and align opportunities with potential funding sources (e.g., USEPA's 319 program, state grants). The study was conducted under an 18 month timeline with oversight from these entities as well as a technical advisory body with representatives from other federal and state agencies. While broader watershed goals were considered, the primary motivations center on the missions of these entities. 

A description of local problems and overarching management goals provided the foundation for data compilation, analyses, diagnosis of underlying stressors, and helped guide selection of management actions (USEPA 2008, USACE 2022). The process of problem identification and goal setting is a key opportunity for incorporating stakeholders in ecosystem management writ large (Dillard et al. 2021) and developing watershed plans specifically (USEPA 2008). Public participation exists on a large spectrum from  informing citizens of activities to empowering stakeholders in decision-making processes (IAP2 2018). For this study, stakeholders were involved through outreach activities to ensure that their concerns and aspirations were understood, considered, and reflected in the watershed plan. Biweekly progress meetings were conducted from October 2024 to December 2025 with technical stakeholders from Conway Corporation, federal agencies (USACE, NRCS, etc.), and the Arkansas Department of Agriculture. Additionally, the experiences of watershed residents, lake users, and other members of the public were incorporated through two facilitated public meetings (May 2025 and January 2026) and a public website. 

Three primary problem statements were synthesized from stakeholder input, subsequent technical analyses, and prior scientific studies in the watershed (e.g., Hart 2014). First, Brewer Lake provides municipal water supply for 70,000 residents, and both Conway Corporation and local residents want to ensure the security, resilience, and sustainability of this resource. Second, water quality is a growing concern among both lake managers and residents. On short time scales, this manifests as increasing nutrient loads and associated increases in water treatment cost for Conway Corporation. On longer time scales, sediment and nutrient delivery have the potential to reduce storage volume or increase the likelihood of algal blooms. Third, watershed residents expressed a desire to preserve the ecological integrity and beauty of this minimally developed landscape as a legacy of opportunities for future generations. A key constraint was identified as a a desire to avoid infringing on local property owners (e.g., through takings or regulation) in a watershed with almost exclusively private land ownership. 

The overarching goal for the watershed management plan was to identify a set of management actions and priority locations that help the community protect the watershed as a multi-generational asset and Conway Corporation secure a sustainable water supply. This vision sets the general trajectory for the watershed plan as a whole, but more refined objectives were needed to assess the relative merits of management activities (Table 2). The specific objectives for the watershed management plan center on nitrogen, phosphorous, and sediment as indicators of riverine water quality and sustainability of the water supply from the lake. Indicator metrics were selected for each objective with an emphasis on capturing large-scale and long-term trends. 

While the primary objectives centered on water quality, stakeholders expressed other areas of concern and interest in outcomes of watershed management. These secondary or ancillary objectives are not the focus of watershed management practices, so they will not be address here. However, these outcomes are important to track and communicate in the context of the broader vision for the watershed.

## *2.3. Exploratory Assessment of Feasible Targets*

(**Looking for Maya's help here.**)  

A numeric target or threshold for each indicator helps judge the relative success of watershed management actions in achieving the objectives. However, numerical targets are challenging to develop without technical information on feasibility in a specific geography. Initial targets were developed qualitatively and then confirmed using simple modeling exercises.

The technical advisory team established the initial numerical targets. The 2020 algal bloom in Brewer Lake was identified as an undesirable outcome by the technical stakeholder advisory group, and a general preference was identified for reducing nitrogen, phosphorous, and sediment loading to the reservoir. Load reductions were judged relative to a baseline of 2009-2023, which represents a recent period in which algal blooms were infrequent, short duration, or low consequence. A 15% reduction from this baseline was identified based on the technical advisory group’s understanding of what is achievable. This level of reduction was viewed as ambitious but achievable relative to long-term program tracking in other locations with water quality management programs like New York Harbor (HRF 2021) and Chesapeake Bay (Zhang et al. 2023).

These targets were then analyzed using the EPA’s Pollutant Load Estimation Tool (PLET) to estimate removal efficiency of three scenarios of best management practices (BMPs) at the watershed-scale. PLET is a spatially lumped calculator treating the entire watershed as one analytical domain. Land cover serves as the primary driver of removal efficiency in PLET, and the National Land Cover Data Set (NLCD) from 2021 was used to parameterize the model. This model provides a low level of effort for preliminary exploration of feasibility.

Three sets of BMPs were executed in PLET based on the pasture, river, and combined scenarios. The BMP calculator was configured such that similar practices were used in series, and dissimilar practices were used in parallel. All practices were assumed to be applied in series with either grassed or forested riparian buffers due to the well-described efficacy of buffer zones (Ayala-Torres et al. 2025). Area treated by each practice was calculated by dividing the current pasture area evenly into each set of practices. No BMP calculations were performed for urban areas due to its insignificant pollutant load contribution in this watershed. The three exploratory scenarios were:  

- *Pasture BMPs*. This scenario focused  on pasture lands as a key source of sediment and nutrient inputs and includes actions like cattle exclusion, rotational grazing, pasture planting, and alternative water supplies.  
- *River BMPs*. This scenario focused on actions within river corridors such as riparian buffer enhancement and streambank stabilization. These actions assume that river corridors may provide better alignment for real estate actions (e.g., voluntary programs, incentives, easements, acquisitions), given flooding potential and other regulatory limits (e.g., buffer ordinances).  
- *Combined BMPs*. This scenario combines the strategies into a single scenario applying both practices.

```{r}
#Specify pollutant removal efficiency from PLET
PLET <- data.frame(matrix(NA, nrow=3, ncol=4))
colnames(PLET) <- c("Scenario", "Sediment", "Nitrogen", "Phosphorous")
PLET$Scenario <- c("Pasture BMPs", "River BMPs", "Combined BMPs")
PLET$Sediment <- c(0.700, 0.709, 0.693)
PLET$Nitrogen <- c(0.422, 0.685, 0.728)
PLET$Phosphorous <- c(0.550, 0.684, 0.711)

#Specify colors for each of the constituents
PLET.colors <- viridis(3)
```


## *2.4. Assessing Watershed Condition*

(**Looking for Drew's help here.**)  

- Why is watershed modeling needed? Establish baseline conditions, understand sources at locations without data, predict effectiveness of management actions (eventually).  
- HSPF model setup: inputs, spatial and temporal resolution, calibration, goodness-of-fit.
- Model application to estimate load for sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorous.


## *2.5. Prioritization of Catchments*

The extent of BMP application may be significantly reduced, if actions are placed strategically throughout the watershed in locations with the greatest return-on-investment. This section describes a suite of analyses to identify strategically important catchments for BMP application. The HSPF model used 60 sub-catchments to provide sufficient predictive capability, but this spatial resolution was considered finer scale (**XXX** mi^2^ average size) than needed for management. These sub-catchments were aggregated into 26 larger catchments for prioritization purposes (**XXX** mi^2^ average size), based on slope, soil type, land use, and proximity to Brewer Lake. 

To identify high-reward areas, or areas in the watershed where BMPs would provide the greatest return-on-investment, the sub-catchments were prioritized using two different methods: ranking and multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The ranking method identified sub-catchments with high pollutant loading and feasibility for management based on separate criteria. Conversely, the MCDA compared each sub-catchment based on a weighted average of multiple criteria summarized in a single score. Each technique provides different insights into the prioritization process, and catchments identified as high reward under different sets of assumptions provide confidence that BMP application in these areas will provide the greatest return-on-investment.

### 2.5.1. Prioritization Method 1 – Ranking

Two main factors often drive the efficacy of a watershed management action. First, will it achieve the technical objectives (in this case related to sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorous reduction)? Second, can the action be feasibly implemented? The highest priority actions would then be those where actions are feasible to achieve the load reduction goals. 

The flux of sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorous from HSPF were used to assess the degree to which technical objectives were achieved. The catchments were ranked from lowest to highest loading for each constituent. The average rank across all three constituents was used as a general proxy for identifying “problem areas” in the watershed. 

Ideally, the feasibility of an action could be assessed relative to the total project cost, stakeholder surveys, or other data. However, no direct metrics were available for all sites in this watershed, and a suite of proxy metrics were used as a relative metric of feasibility. First, appraised land value from tax records was used as a general proxy for affordability. Second, the forested proportion of a 100-foot riparian area was used as a surrogate for the durability of BMPs with the assumption that, all things equal, BMPs would perform better in sites with forested buffers. Third, time of travel from the catchment outlet to Brewer Lake (from HSPF) was used as a proxy for the directness of the effects on Brewer Lake water quality. The catchments were then ranked from lowest to highest on these factors, and the average rank was used as a general proxy for the feasibility of actions.

The relative rankings of load and feasibility factors provided multiple pathways for identifying priority catchments. First, catchments were selected that provided the greatest level of either technical outcomes or feasibility. Second, catchments were identified based on trade-off analysis analogous to cost-effectiveness analysis (Newbold 2002, Menichino et al. 2025). Catchments with higher feasibility at the same level of water quality load or higher pollutant load at the same level of feasibility were identified as "dominant" alternatives. Finally, catchments providing low levels of either technical objectives or feasibility were eliminated from consideration in future analysis.

brewer.rank$Feasibility <- apply(cbind(brewer.rank$Affordability, brewer.rank$Buffer, brewer.rank$TravelTime), 1, mean)
```

### 2.5.2. Prioritization Method 2 – Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA)

Many methods have been developed for comparing disparate metrics using a spectrum of qualitative to quantitative techniques (Linkov et al. 2009). Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) provides a set of methods for normalizing metrics with different units and scales and combining those metrics into a single score for comparing alternatives, which has proven particularly useful for the multi-objective context of watershed planning (Yaryan Hall and Bledsoe 2023).

A form of MCDA was used to prioritize catchments in the Brewer Lake watershed using a weighted-score based on multiple criteria. Five criteria were included in this analysis: flux of sediment, flux of total nitrogen, flux of total phosphorous, proportion of land use in pasture, and distance from the catchment outlet to Brewer Lake. All metrics were converted to a 1 to 5 scale for comparison across different units with 1 and 5 representing less and more preferrable outcomes, respectively. Flux scores were computed based on the quantiles of the data from 0-20%, 20-40%, 40-60%, 60-80%, and 80-100% with corresponding scores of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Land use was assessed based on proportion of pasture in the catchment with thresholds at < 30%, 30-40%, 40-50%, 50-60%, and > 60% for 1 to 5 scores. Distance to the lake was normalized as 0 miles, 0-1 miles, 1-2 miles, 2-3 miles, 3-4 miles, and > 4 miles for scores 5 to 1. Weighting was determined based on pairwise comparison of the relative importance of each criteria, where sediment, nitrogen, phosphorous, land use, and distance were ultimately weighted as 20%, 27%, 33%, 13%, and 7%, respectively. All normalized metrics were combined through a weighted-average to produce an overall score for each catchment on a 1 to 5 scale, where 5 represents the highest priority catchment.

## *2.6. Efficacy of Management Actions in Priority Catchments*

**Looking for Maya's help here. I think we will need ~2 methods paragraphs covering the following.**

- Combining analysis of management actions with the priority locations.   
- Second round of PLET analysis in the priority catchments.  
- Verification of the ability to achieve targets.  
- Bracketing in the scale of activity needed for watershed managers (i.e., ranges of area).

# **Results**

Overview of the question-centric approach to presenting the results.


## *Can watershed management achieve the load reduction targets?*

The three BMP scenarios produced different rates of pollutant removal and required different amounts of pasture area to achieve the 15% pollutant reduction targets (Figure 2). PLET analyses indicate that pasture-oriented practices are more effective for nitrogen removal, whereas river-oriented practices more efficiently remove phosphorous and sediment. Using only pasture management practices, large amounts of pasture land would need to be converted to BMP application (i.e., 62% of existing pasture). River corridor BMPs achieve the load targets with significantly less pasture conversion (i.e., 43% of existing pasture), and combinations of practices further reduce land requirements (i.e., 41% of existing pasture). Notably, these values do not imply taking land out of pasture-oriented uses, but instead application of BMPs in those lands (e.g., cattle fencing, rotational grazing, poultry litter management). While ambitious in the scope and scale of BMP application, PLET results indicate that the nutrient removal targets are feasible, particularly with an emphasis on river corridor management.

# **Discussion**

**Potential topics that could be ripe for discussion**.  

- Methods for multi-purpose planning are rapidly evolving. Methods can be applied in conjunction (rather than picking one approach). Applying multiple tools for different levels of effort (Hanson et al. 2022) and examining alignment of the tools (McKay et al. 2019).
- Multi-purpose planning is hard. Trade-offs are challenging to think through. Secondary objectives were important here, but played little role in decision making.  
- Misalignment between physical processes and jurisdictional boundaries (Cohen and Davidson 2011).  
- Watershed prioritization is simply the first step. More detailed analyses are needed for site-scale design.  
- The temporal scale of watershed planning is long-term, so we need to arm decision-makers with general targets and ranges of effort (not just a hit list of projects).
